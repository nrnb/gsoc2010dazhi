!Series_summary = A series of reports over the last few years have indicated that a much larger portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed than can be accounted for by currently annotated genes, but the quantity and nature of these additional transcripts remains unclear. Here, we have used data from single- and paired-end RNA-Seq and tiling arrays to assess the quantity and composition of transcripts in PolyA+ RNA from human and mouse tissues. Relative to tiling arrays, RNA-Seq identifies many fewer transcribed regions (‘‘seqfrags’’) outside known exons and ncRNAs. Most nonexonic seqfrags are in introns, raising the possibility that they are fragments of pre-mRNAs. The chromosomal locations of the majority of intergenic seqfrags in RNA-Seq data are near known genes, consistent with alternative cleavage and polyadenylation site usage, promoter- and terminator-associated transcripts, or new alternative exons; indeed, reads that bridge splice sites identified 4,544 new exons, affecting 3,554 genes. Most of the remaining seqfrags correspond to either single reads that display characteristics of random sampling from a low-level background or several thousand small transcripts (median length = 111 bp) present at higher levels, which also tend to display sequence conservation and originate from regions with open chromatin. We conclude that, while there are bona fide new intergenic transcripts, their number and abundance is generally low in comparison to known exons, and the genome is not as pervasively transcribed as previously reported.

!Platform_description = The GeneChip® Human Tiling 2.0R Array Set is designed for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. This set of seven arrays contains approximately 45 million oligonucleotide probes to interrogate the human genome. Each array in the set contains over 6.5 million perfect match probes to specifically interrogate genomic regions.
!Platform_description = Sequences used in the design of the Human Tiling 2.0R Array Set were selected from NCBI human genome assembly (Build 34). Repetitive elements were removed by RepeatMasker. The Human Tiling 2.0R Array Set is available either as a whole-genome set of seven arrays (P/N 900772), or individual arrays from the set may be purchased separately. The GeneChip® Human Promoter 1.0R Array is a subset of the Human Tiling 2.0R Tiling Array Set, and the content was chosen specifically to analyze protein/DNA interactions within promoter regions.
!Platform_description = Probes are tiled at an average resolution of 35 base pair, as measured from the central position of adjacent 25-mer oligos, leaving a gap of approximately 10bp between probes. Oligonucleotide probes are synthesized in situ complementary to each corresponding sequence.
